I have given you my data labling script and my original stock market time series data lstm. i want you to update the lstm arciteture is use GeLu instead of ReLu and make it only a forward lstm and not a bidirectional.  my data starts off with Open,high,low,close, and volume, then the adat labing scripts goes in and adds all the indicators then sigansl class which is what the model should output. update the lstm model acoridingly. i will also give you some of claude 4 opus chat for you to use.
I'll update your LSTM model to handle the 70+ indicators effectively. The key changes will include:
1. Proper input dimension handling
2. Feature preprocessing and normalization
3. Feature grouping for better learning
4. Adaptive architecture based on input complexity
Looking at your complex LSTM model for stock market trading, I have several thoughts on both the architecture and the overall approach:
Architecture Observations
Your model is indeed very sophisticated - perhaps even over-engineered for this task. With ~2.7 million parameters, it includes:
* Multi-scale temporal convolutions (good for capturing patterns at different time scales)
* Bidirectional LSTMs with residual connections (though bidirectional might not be appropriate for real-time trading)
* Multi-head attention mechanisms
* Multiple output heads with ensemble combination
* Positional encoding
**Key Concerns:**
1. **Bidirectional LSTMs**: These look at future data, which isn't available in live trading. You should use regular (forward-only) LSTMs.
2. **Model Complexity**: With 4 LSTM layers, multiple attention heads, and ensemble outputs, this model might be prone to overfitting, especially on the relatively simple patterns in 5-minute candles.
3. **Input Features**: Your 9 input features (OHLCV + 4 MAs) are reasonable, but you might benefit from:
   * Normalized/scaled inputs
   * Additional technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   * Volume-based indicators
   * Market microstructure features
Trading-Specific Considerations
1. **Class Imbalance**: In real markets, "hold" signals typically dominate. Your model needs to handle this imbalance.
2. **Transaction Costs**: The model doesn't account for spreads, commissions, or slippage, which can eliminate profits from frequent trading.
3. **Risk Management**: No position sizing or stop-loss logic is built in.
4. **Market Regime Changes**: Financial markets are non-stationary. A model trained on bull market data may fail in bear markets.
Practical Suggestions
1. **Simplify First**: Start with a much simpler model (1-2 LSTM layers, <100k parameters) and only add complexity if it demonstrably improves out-of-sample performance.
2. **Better Features**: Consider adding:
   * Price momentum indicators
   * Volatility measures
   * Time-of-day encoding
   * Market sentiment indicators
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Before going live:
   * Extensive backtesting with realistic transaction costs
   * Walk-forward analysis
   * Paper trading for at least a few months
   * Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
4. **Architecture Fixes**:
python

```python
# Replace bidirectional LSTM with forward-only
self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
    input_size, hidden_size,
    num_layers=num_layers,
    dropout=dropout,
    bidirectional=False,  # Changed
    batch_first=True
)
```

1. **Consider Alternatives**: Many successful trading systems use:
   * Ensemble methods (Random Forests, XGBoost)
   * Reinforcement learning
   * Traditional technical analysis with ML-optimized parameters
Remember, even with a perfect model, profitable algorithmic trading is extremely difficult. The market is highly efficient, and any edge tends to decay quickly as others discover similar patterns. Focus on robust risk management and realistic expectations rather than model complexity.
